# gameboy-test-data

Full test data for CPU operations on the Gameboy. The test data is in the same format as https://github.com/TomHarte/ProcessorTests.

Each file contains 10,000 tests for each instruction, which the exception of `CB.json` which contains 100,000 tests.

Sample test:

| `name`    | Provided for human consumption and has no formal meaning.                                                                                                                 |
| `initial` | The initial state of the processor; `ram` contains a list of values to store in memory prior to execution, each one in the form `[address, value]`.                       |
| `final`   | The state of the processor and relevant memory contents after execution.                                                                                                  |
| `cycles`  | A cycle-by-cycle breakdown of bus activity in the form `[address, value, type]` where type is either `"read"` or `"write"`. Note: Cycles in this case refers to M-cycles. |
